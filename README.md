# Restro_Review_Analysis-using-NLP
I have 1000 reviews for a restaurant based on that i will classify them as 1(Good) and 1(bad).
In this pext preprocessing has been done with BOW and TF-IDF method matrix and classification model has been prepared using multinomial naive bayes.
I have also tried XGBoost and Randomized search for boosting and tuning.
